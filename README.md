# Machine-Lerning

## Project Overview
This project addresses the challenge of student attrition in bootcamps. It develops a predictive model to identify whether students are likely to continue or withdraw from a bootcamp program. The goal is to use insights from the model to implement strategies that can help reduce dropout rates and improve student retention
